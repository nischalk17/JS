/*
In jQuery, chaining refers to the practice of linking multiple method calls together in a single statement. 
This is possible because most jQuery methods return the jQuery object itself, allowing you to call another method on the same set of elements. 
Chaining is a concise and readable way to perform multiple actions on the same element(s) without repeatedly selecting them.
